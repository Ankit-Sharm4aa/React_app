# React_app
This is a test application for react and also it's my first react app.........!

As I mentioned above it's a testing app. So, it can generate upto 8 paragraphs. 

In this app, paragraphs will be generated based upon no. of paragraphs entered or mentioned in the field 

I have used react hook {useState} in this application............! 
Basically it checks the current state and with the help of update state, I managed to update the data using form tag that I used in JSX 

ALL the JSX part is stored in src/App.js file & all of the data that I am exporting i.e all of the paragraphs are stored in src/data.js file 

I HOPE U FIND THIS HELPFUL ....!
